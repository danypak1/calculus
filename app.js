   Every fact below has exactly one home, the course file. Hand-editing one here
   is the failure this pair of scripts exists to prevent: course #2 was scaffolded
   from this file and inherited course #1's question counts, exam length, price
   and title, all of which the gates then passed without a word.

   PER_MODULE  — every module carries the same question set, and the locked-module
                 page says so rather than counting something it may not fetch.
   PRICE/CONTACT — where the paid line falls, for the copy that has to say so.
                 Api.FREE_MODULES is the machine-readable half and is what the
                 code branches on.
   HAS_SIGNALS — whether this course has a "questions the lectures already graded"
                 document. Not every course does; the tile is hidden when it does
                 not, rather than offering a page that cannot load.
   HAS_PROBLEMS — whether modules ship a problem set (exercises with worked
                 solutions) as their own tab. A course whose problems live inside
                 its notes has none, and the tab is not offered.
   COURSE_DOCS — the catalogue of course-wide reference pages (cheat sheets, a
                 diagnostic): id, title and whether each is free. Titles only —
                 what a paid one contains comes from the Worker. Empty list means
                 the whole #/docs surface is hidden. */
